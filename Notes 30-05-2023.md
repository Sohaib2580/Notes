# End Of Day Report:

## Meeting with Team Member:
I have done a meeting with my team member Mudasir in which we discussed what we have learned till now from our training manual, training sessions, teams, and Github.

## Meeting With Samim:
After that, I joined a meeting with Samim in which he helped me with my GitHub profile because I was facing an issue with it so in that meeting he helped me to solve that issue.

## Training Session:
After meeting with Samim I joined a training session in which I learned about branches, pull requests, and forks and how to create them in GitHub. I have learned;

1) **Branch:** In Git and GitHub, a branch is a separate line of development that allows you to work on different features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. When you create a branch, you essentially create a copy of the codebase at a specific point in time. This enables you to make changes and commit them independently from the main branch (often called the "master" or "main" branch). Branches are useful for collaboration and managing different tasks simultaneously.

2) **Pull Request:** A pull request is a GitHub feature that enables developers to propose changes they've made in their branch to be reviewed and merged into another branch, typically the main branch. When you're ready to merge your changes into the main branch, you open a pull request. It serves as a way to notify other developers about your proposed changes and provides a space for discussion and review. Other team members can review the changes, leave comments, suggest modifications, and approve or reject the pull request. Once the changes are reviewed and approved, they can be merged into the target branch.

3) **Fork:** Forking is a process in GitHub that allows you to create your copy of a repository from another user or organization. When you fork a repository, you create an independent copy of the entire project, including all the code, history, branches, and commits. This copy is stored in your GitHub account and allows you to make changes to the project without affecting the original repository. Forking is often used when you want to contribute to a project that is maintained by someone else. You can make changes in your forked repository, create branches, and submit pull requests to propose incorporating your changes, into the original repository.

## Team Meeting:
After our training session, I joined the meeting with my team leader Dua and my team member Mudasir in which we discussed our working hours and our skills.
